### Desired Quality & Performance

#### Quality Requirements

- **Data Accuracy**: Health signals should correctly reflect package status from npm and GitHub  
- **Data Completeness**: Essential metadata (downloads, stars, issues) should be available for queried packages  
- **Error Handling**: The system should continue functioning when external APIs fail or return incomplete data  
- **Data Consistency**: Package information should remain consistent across multiple requests within a short time frame (assuming no significant upstream changes)

#### Performance Requirements

- **Efficiency**: Responses should be fast enough to support real-time use in a browser extension  
- **Scalability**: The system should support multiple package queries in parallel without significant delay  

### Tests Performed

#### Functional Tests
- **API Integration Tests**: Verify successful data retrieval from different APIs (e.g., npm registry and GitHub)
- **Data Validation Tests**: Verify that essential package metadata is properly extracted and structured
- **Error Handling Tests**: Verify the system continues functioning when external APIs are unavailable or requests return errors
- **Data Consistency Tests**: Verify that querying the same package multiple times within a short period yields consistent results
- **Edge Case Tests**: Verify the system can handle unusual packages (e.g. no GitHub repo, private packages, deprecated packages)
- **Chrome Extension Tests**: Verify the extension displays data correctly and handles loading states appropriately

#### Performance Tests
- **Response Time Tests**: Measure how quickly package queries return results under normal usage
- **[Not completed] Load/Stress Testing**: Planned but not implemented — intended to simulate multiple concurrent queries and observe system stability

### Evaluation of the Current System's Quality and Performance
| Category              | Evaluation                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Accuracy**     | ✅ Health ratings are based on live metadata from npm and GitHub                             |
| **Data Completeness** | ✅ All five usability dimensions are represented, and raw data is included for traceability  |
| **Data Consistency**  | ✅ Ratings remain stable unless there are actual changes to upstream data                    |
| **Error Handling**    | ✅ Incomplete or missing data is safely captured in the `errors` field; responses degrade gracefully |
| **Efficiency**        | ✅ The `/health` endpoint responds in under 600 ms for common packages, enabling smooth, real-time use in the Chrome extension |

**Known Limitations and Remediation Plan**  
The current system lacks robust handling of concurrent queries. A caching layer (e.g., Redis) is planned to prevent redundant requests and reduce pressure on upstream APIs.

### Continuous Performance and Quality Assurance

- Run unit tests on each commit to prevent regressions  
- Confirm all quality and performance standards before deploying updates  
- Conduct regular code reviews for maintainability and correctness  
- Manually test the Chrome extension with real package searches prior to each deployment  

#### Monitoring for Alarms & Corresponding Actions

- **Response Time Alerts**: Track when package queries take too long  
  - **Action**: Investigate bottlenecks, configure timeouts, and optimize caching strategies  
- **API Request Error Alerts**: Track failed external requests  
  - **Action**: Retry with exponential backoff, log failures, and display user-friendly messages  
- **Data Quality Alerts**: Detect incomplete or suspicious data  
  - **Action**: Flag problematic results and notify users when data may be unreliable
